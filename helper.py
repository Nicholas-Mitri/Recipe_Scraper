"""
Recipe PDF File Renamer

This script renames recipe PDF files in the 'recipe_pdfs' directory to a more readable format.
It extracts words from filenames, converts them to title case, and creates a new filename.

The script:
- Finds all PDF files in the recipe_pdfs directory
- Extracts words from each filename using regex
- Creates a new filename in Title Case format
- Renames the files with the new format
- Handles errors and provides feedback on the renaming process
